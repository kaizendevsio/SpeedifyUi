### Files Modified
- [`XNetwork/Components/Pages/Home.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Pages/Home.razor)
- [`XNetwork/Components/Custom/ConnectionSummary.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Custom/ConnectionSummary.razor)

### Issue/Task
Fix the signal bar visualization to look like proper WiFi signal strength indicators instead of the current odd-looking bars.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Home.razor Adapter Signal Bars (Lines 58-68)
**Before**: 5 horizontal bars with increasing heights, vertically stacked using flex-col
**After**: 4 vertical bars with increasing heights, bottom-aligned using flex items-end
- Changed from 5 bars to 4 bars (standard WiFi indicator)
- Changed layout from `flex flex-col` to `flex items-end` for bottom alignment
- Replaced dynamic `style="height: @(barHeight)px"` with Tailwind height classes (h-2, h-3, h-4, h-6)
- Added proper spacing with `gap-0.5` and width constraints `w-10 h-6`
- Added `w-1.5 rounded-sm` for bar styling
- Bars now have heights: 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px (25%, 37.5%, 50%, 100%)

#### 2. Updated GetSignalStrength() Method (Lines 218-230)
**Before**: Returned 1-5 bars
**After**: Returns 0-4 bars
- Changed return values to match 4-bar system
- 4 bars = Excellent (latency < 50ms, loss < 1%)
- 3 bars = Good (latency < 100ms, loss < 3%)
- 2 bars = Fair (latency < 200ms, loss < 5%)
- 1 bar = Poor (latency < 300ms, loss < 10%)
- 0 bars = Very poor/disconnected

#### 3. Updated GetSignalColor() Method (Lines 232-242)
**Before**: Handled 5 strength levels (1-5)
**After**: Handles 4 strength levels (0-4)
- Updated color mapping: 4=green, 3=cyan, 2=yellow, 1=orange, 0=red

#### 4. Replaced FontAwesome Icon in ConnectionSummary.razor (Lines 7-29)
**Before**: Used `<i class="fas fa-signal">` with dynamic color classes
**After**: Custom 4-bar signal indicator matching adapter cards
- Removed `GetSignalIcon()` method (no longer needed)
- Replaced `GetSignalColor()` with `GetConnectionStatus()` tuple method
- Added `GetSignalBarCount()` helper method
- Signal bars now match the same WiFi-style design as adapter cards

#### 5. Added GetSignalBarCount() Helper Method (Lines 106-116)
Maps connection status strings to bar counts:
- "Excellent Connection" → 4 bars
- "Good Connection" → 3 bars  
- "Fair Connection" → 2 bars
- "Partial Connection" → 1 bar
- "Poor/Disconnected" → 0 bars

### Visual Design Specifications
- **Total bars**: 4 (not 5)
- **Bar widths**: 6px (w-1.5 in Tailwind)
- **Bar heights**: 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px (h-2, h-3, h-4, h-6)
- **Gap between bars**: 2px (gap-0.5)
- **Alignment**: `items-end` to align bars at bottom
- **Border radius**: `rounded-sm` for subtle rounding
- **Colors**: 
  - Green (green-400) for excellent (4 bars)
  - Cyan (cyan-400) for good (3 bars)
  - Yellow (yellow-400) for fair (2 bars)
  - Orange (orange-400) for poor (1 bar)
  - Red (red-400) for very poor (0 bars)
  - Slate-700 for inactive bars

### Build Results
- **Status**: Build succeeded ✓
- **Warnings**: 16 pre-existing warnings (none related to these changes)
- **Errors**: 0

### Important Notes
- Signal bars now follow standard WiFi/cellular signal strength visualization patterns
- Both overall connection card and adapter cards use consistent signal bar styling
- Bars are bottom-aligned and increase in height from left to right
- Color-coding provides immediate visual feedback on connection quality
- The 4-bar system is more standard and recognizable than the previous 5-bar implementation

### Testing Recommendations
- Verify signal bars render correctly for all connection states (excellent, good, fair, poor, disconnected)
- Test that bar colors match connection quality appropriately
- Ensure bars are properly aligned and spaced in both overall card and adapter cards

**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

### Files Modified
- [`XNetwork/Components/Custom/ConnectionSummary.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Custom/ConnectionSummary.razor:82-94)
- [`XNetwork/Components/Pages/Statistics.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Pages/Statistics.razor:55-81,233-277)
- [`XNetwork/wwwroot/js/statisticsCharts.js`](XNetwork/wwwroot/js/statisticsCharts.js:38-47,183-192)
- [`XNetwork/Components/Pages/Settings.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Pages/Settings.razor:62-79,184-231)

### Issue/Task
Fixed three critical issues based on user feedback and screenshots:
1. Overall card signal bars not updating dynamically
2. Statistics/Details page chart improvements (filter inactive adapters, separate upload/download, smooth lines)
3. Settings page - Add reconnect and restart service buttons

### Changes Made

#### Issue 1: Signal Bars Reactive Updates (ConnectionSummary.razor)

**Problem**: Signal bars on ConnectionSummary card weren't updating when connection status changed.

**Fix** (Line 82-94):
- Added `await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged)` in `OnParametersSetAsync()` method
- Forces component re-render when `ConnectionStatus`, `Latency`, `Download`, or `Upload` parameters change
- Signal bars now recalculate and display correctly when stats update

**Code Added**:
```csharp
// Force re-render when connection status or stats change
await InvokeAsync(StateHasChanged);
```

#### Issue 2a: Filter Inactive Adapters from Charts (Statistics.razor)

**Problem**: Charts displayed ALL adapters including disconnected/inactive ones.

**Fixes**:
1. Added `GetActiveAdapters()` method (Lines 258-267):
   - Filters adapters to only show "connected", "connecting", or "standby" states
   - Excludes "disconnected" and other inactive states from charts

2. Updated `GetAdapterLegend()` method (Lines 233-251):
   - Renamed from `GetLatencyLegend()` to be reusable for all charts
   - Uses `GetActiveAdapters()` to populate legend with only active adapters
   - Updated color palette to match dashboard sparkline

3. Updated `InitializeChartsInternal()` (Lines 262-277):
   - Uses `GetActiveAdapters()` instead of all `_adapters`
   - Added validation to check if any active adapters exist before chart initialization
   - Sets appropriate error message if no active connections found

**Result**: Charts now only display data for connected/active adapters, reducing clutter and improving clarity.

#### Issue 2b: Separate Upload and Download Charts (Statistics.razor)

**Problem**: Upload and Download were combined in one "Real-time Throughput" chart.

**Fix** (Lines 55-81):
- Changed chart layout from combined throughput to separate charts:
  - **Download Speed (Mbps)** - First chart, cyan line
  - **Upload Speed (Mbps)** - Second chart, pink line  
  - **Latency (ms)** - Third chart (unchanged position)
  - **Packet Loss (%)** - Fourth chart (unchanged position)

- Updated all charts to use `GetAdapterLegend()` for consistent legend display
- Enabled legends for Upload and Loss charts (previously disabled)

**Before**: 1 throughput chart with both download/upload
**After**: 2 separate charts for clearer visualization

#### Issue 2c: Smooth Chart Lines (statisticsCharts.js)

**Problem**: Chart lines were angular/jagged instead of smooth.

**Fixes**:

1. Statistics page line charts (Lines 38-47):
```javascript
tension: 0.4, // Smooth bezier curves (increased from 0.1)
cubicInterpolationMode: 'monotone', // Smooth interpolation
```

2. Dashboard sparkline chart (Lines 183-192):
```javascript
tension: 0.4, // Smooth bezier curves  
cubicInterpolationMode: 'monotone', // Smooth interpolation
```

**Result**: All line charts now display smooth, curved lines using bezier interpolation for better visual aesthetics.

#### Issue 3: Settings Page Control Buttons (Settings.razor)

**Problem**: Settings page lacked reconnect and restart control buttons.

**Fixes**:

1. Updated Connection Controls UI (Lines 62-79):
   - Changed "Disconnect All" icon from `fa-power-off` to `fa-unlink` (more appropriate)
   - Added "Reconnect All Connections" button:
     - Blue color scheme (`bg-blue-600/20 hover:bg-blue-600/30 text-blue-400`)
     - Icon: `fa-sync`
   - Updated "Restart Speedify Service" button:
     - Changed to orange color scheme (`bg-orange-600/20 hover:bg-orange-600/30 text-orange-400`)
     - Icon: `fa-power-off` (moved from Disconnect)

2. Added `ReconnectAll()` method (Lines 210-231):
   - Calls `SpeedifyService.StopAsync()` to disconnect all
   - Waits 2 seconds for graceful disconnection
   - Calls `SpeedifyService.StartAsync()` to reconnect
   - Includes proper error handling and UI state management
   - Logs actions to console for debugging

**Button Order**:
1. Disconnect All (red) - Stops all connections
2. Reconnect All (blue) - Disconnects then reconnects
3. Restart Service (orange) - Restarts Speedify daemon

### Build Results
- **Status**: Build succeeded ✓
- **Warnings**: 16 pre-existing warnings (none related to these changes)
- **Errors**: 0
- **Exit Code**: 0

### Important Notes

#### Signal Bars
- `StateHasChanged()` must be called explicitly in Blazor components when parameters change to ensure UI updates
- Signal bars now properly reflect real-time connection status changes

#### Chart Filtering
- Active adapter filtering prevents visual clutter from disconnected adapters
- States considered "active": connected, connecting, standby
- States filtered out: disconnected, idle, error, etc.
- Empty adapter check prevents chart initialization errors

#### Chart Smoothing
- `tension: 0.4` provides optimal balance between smoothness and data accuracy
- `cubicInterpolationMode: 'monotone'` prevents overshooting and maintains data trends
- Applied consistently across all line charts (statistics and dashboard)

#### Settings Controls
- Reconnect All provides convenient one-click reconnection (common use case)
- 2-second delay between stop and start prevents race conditions
- Button color coding (red/blue/orange) indicates action severity
- All buttons respect `_isProcessing` state to prevent concurrent operations

### Testing Recommendations
1. **Signal Bars**: Verify bars update when connection status changes (disconnect/reconnect adapters)
2. **Chart Filtering**: Confirm disconnected adapters don't appear in charts, only active ones
3. **Chart Layout**: Verify Download and Upload are in separate charts with appropriate labels
4. **Chart Smoothing**: Check that all line charts display smooth curves, not jagged lines
5. **Reconnect Button**: Test that reconnect sequence works (disconnect → wait → start)
6. **Restart Service**: Verify service restart doesn't cause application crash
7. **Error Handling**: Test buttons with Speedify service stopped to verify error messages display

### Known Limitations
- Chart color palette limited to 6 colors (will cycle if more than 6 adapters active)
- Reconnect timing (2 seconds) may need adjustment based on system performance
- No visual feedback during reconnect operation (could add progress indicator)
- Confirm responsive behavior on different screen sizes
