**Agent**: Claude Code (Sonnet 4.5)

### Files Modified
- [`XNetwork/Components/Pages/Home.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Pages/Home.razor)
- [`XNetwork/Components/Custom/ConnectionSummary.razor`](XNetwork/Components/Custom/ConnectionSummary.razor)

### Issue/Task
Fix the signal bar visualization to look like proper WiFi signal strength indicators instead of the current odd-looking bars.

### Changes Made

#### 1. Updated Home.razor Adapter Signal Bars (Lines 58-68)
**Before**: 5 horizontal bars with increasing heights, vertically stacked using flex-col
**After**: 4 vertical bars with increasing heights, bottom-aligned using flex items-end
- Changed from 5 bars to 4 bars (standard WiFi indicator)
- Changed layout from `flex flex-col` to `flex items-end` for bottom alignment
- Replaced dynamic `style="height: @(barHeight)px"` with Tailwind height classes (h-2, h-3, h-4, h-6)
- Added proper spacing with `gap-0.5` and width constraints `w-10 h-6`
- Added `w-1.5 rounded-sm` for bar styling
- Bars now have heights: 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px (25%, 37.5%, 50%, 100%)

#### 2. Updated GetSignalStrength() Method (Lines 218-230)
**Before**: Returned 1-5 bars
**After**: Returns 0-4 bars
- Changed return values to match 4-bar system
- 4 bars = Excellent (latency < 50ms, loss < 1%)
- 3 bars = Good (latency < 100ms, loss < 3%)
- 2 bars = Fair (latency < 200ms, loss < 5%)
- 1 bar = Poor (latency < 300ms, loss < 10%)
- 0 bars = Very poor/disconnected

#### 3. Updated GetSignalColor() Method (Lines 232-242)
**Before**: Handled 5 strength levels (1-5)
**After**: Handles 4 strength levels (0-4)
- Updated color mapping: 4=green, 3=cyan, 2=yellow, 1=orange, 0=red

#### 4. Replaced FontAwesome Icon in ConnectionSummary.razor (Lines 7-29)
**Before**: Used `<i class="fas fa-signal">` with dynamic color classes
**After**: Custom 4-bar signal indicator matching adapter cards
- Removed `GetSignalIcon()` method (no longer needed)
- Replaced `GetSignalColor()` with `GetConnectionStatus()` tuple method
- Added `GetSignalBarCount()` helper method
- Signal bars now match the same WiFi-style design as adapter cards

#### 5. Added GetSignalBarCount() Helper Method (Lines 106-116)
Maps connection status strings to bar counts:
- "Excellent Connection" → 4 bars
- "Good Connection" → 3 bars  
- "Fair Connection" → 2 bars
- "Partial Connection" → 1 bar
- "Poor/Disconnected" → 0 bars

### Visual Design Specifications
- **Total bars**: 4 (not 5)
- **Bar widths**: 6px (w-1.5 in Tailwind)
- **Bar heights**: 8px, 12px, 16px, 24px (h-2, h-3, h-4, h-6)
- **Gap between bars**: 2px (gap-0.5)
- **Alignment**: `items-end` to align bars at bottom
- **Border radius**: `rounded-sm` for subtle rounding
- **Colors**: 
  - Green (green-400) for excellent (4 bars)
  - Cyan (cyan-400) for good (3 bars)
  - Yellow (yellow-400) for fair (2 bars)
  - Orange (orange-400) for poor (1 bar)
  - Red (red-400) for very poor (0 bars)
  - Slate-700 for inactive bars

### Build Results
- **Status**: Build succeeded ✓
- **Warnings**: 16 pre-existing warnings (none related to these changes)
- **Errors**: 0

### Important Notes
- Signal bars now follow standard WiFi/cellular signal strength visualization patterns
- Both overall connection card and adapter cards use consistent signal bar styling
- Bars are bottom-aligned and increase in height from left to right
- Color-coding provides immediate visual feedback on connection quality
- The 4-bar system is more standard and recognizable than the previous 5-bar implementation

### Testing Recommendations
- Verify signal bars render correctly for all connection states (excellent, good, fair, poor, disconnected)
- Test that bar colors match connection quality appropriately
- Ensure bars are properly aligned and spaced in both overall card and adapter cards
- Confirm responsive behavior on different screen sizes
